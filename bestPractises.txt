What to Test in Unit Testing
A unit test could assert that a method:

Returns an expected value
Throws an exception under the tested condition
Changes the state of the system
Calls another function

Integration testing, it’s important that you verify:

The HTTP status code
The response payload
The response headers
The API performance/response time
